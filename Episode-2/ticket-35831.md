## Problem

The ticket is looking to add reference documentation for `ModelForm` and
its `Meta` class. Some of this documentation exists in topics, but there are
details that are specifically reference documentation that are missing.

## Summarized issue discussion

1. From ticket reporter, jernwerber:
   > As a developer, it would be helpful to be able to have a consolidated reference for the complete set of possible Meta options (ModelFormOptions) that can be used with a ModelForm's Meta class in a single place, rather than having to infer options from other topics or check the Python source.
2. [Clifford agreed](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/35831#comment:2) this
   something that should be documented, but expressed concern about overlap
   with [Topic documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/forms/modelforms/).
3. [jernwerber expressed concern](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/35831#comment:4)
   about where to put the documentation. This is because the
   existing reference docs are written for Model Form Functions and isn't broad enough
   to cover `ModelForm` explicitly.
