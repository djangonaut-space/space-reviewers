## Problem

### Django issue description:
The language and docs version switcher is impossible to use with a keyboard. You cannot tab to focus on the language and documentation version widget. This means the options, which are only visible on hover, are not available to keyboard users.

#### djangoproject.com issue description:
When navigating to the date_hierarchy area in the admin page using a screen reader, no specific description is provided for that section. Currently, the only information announced is that it is a "navigation" area. As a result, screen reader users may find it difficult to understand the purpose of the links contained within this area when they access it. The lack of context makes it unclear what role these links play.
